<!--
   | Map resource names (complexes) to values (features)
   | served by the license manager(s).
   | Resources without a "served" attribute are considered internal
   | Resources with type "track" are reported but not managed
   | The urgency is how much extra weight to give to particular resources.
   | If a 'slot' is weighted with 1000, we can give an extra 10% to
   | a few resources. [Format: INTEGER]
   |
   | The resource 'limit' specifies an upper limit to prevent applications
   | from flooding the cluster and/or prevent jobs from consuming all the
   | available licenses. A negative limit is subtracted from the total
   | to obtain the limit. [Format: INTEGER]
   |
   | Derived resources are combined from sub-elements and inherit the
   | limits from their sub-elements.
   |
   | Resources that are not served and not derived are internal resources
